# Mini Project 1

## Model Selection

Given the dataset-1, fit the 20-degree polynomial to the data. Calculate the MSE w/ and w/o regularization.

## Gradient Descent for Regression

Given  the dataset-2, fit a linear regression model by using stochastic gradient descent.

## Real Life Dataset

Given the Communities and Crime Data Set from the UCI repository (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Communities+and+Crime), fill the missing attributes by using sample mean of each column.
Fit the fixed data using linear regression, and find MSE of the best fit.
